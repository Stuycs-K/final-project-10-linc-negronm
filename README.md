## Overview
The player controls 1 hero character which has a set of moves, abilities, and attributes. Each level of the dungeon is a 31x31 room of tiles that can be moved on with walls surrounding and within the room. Enemies will be randomly placed throughout the room, and they move and attack every turn along with the hero. There will be powerups and items placed throughout the room as well, which give random temporary buffs. To proceed past a room, the hero must reach an exit on the opposite side of the room and have defeated a minimum number of enemies.
